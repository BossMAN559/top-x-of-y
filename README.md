# 2017 Top 4

A simple app to find your 4 most liked photos of 2017 and create a collage.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create a simple web application, using only modern browser technologies,
allowing a user to create a collage of their 4 most popular Instagram photos - based on likes, with comments
as a tie-breaker.

In addition to allowing a user to create a collage of a their most-liked photos, the app should
also serve as an example of what can be built with native, modern, browser technologies.

## About the app

The app is built using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are no dependencies, third-party libraries, imports
or other external resources, with the exception of the [Instragram API](https://www.instagram.com/developer/).

The site is hosted on Github Pages.
