# Privacy Policy

We don't store your data.

It's actually impossible for us to store any data. The way this site is built makes it physically impossible
to store any information on our servers.

We use the Instagram API to retrieve, and display your photos. This means you login through Instagram (we
  never receive any login credentials) and can merely access your previous posts. We cannot post any photos,
  videos, stories or other media to Instagram on your behalf.

Should you decide you want to retract our access to your Instagram profile, you can do that through your
[Instagram Account page](https://www.instagram.com/accounts/manage_access/?hl=en).
